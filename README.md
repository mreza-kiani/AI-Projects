# AI Projects
These are my projects for Artificial Intelligence Course in Spring of 2019 semester. <br/>
We had 7 mandatory projects and 1 optional project. <br/>

0. The assignment 0 was mostly practice with ``jupyter``, ``python`` & its important library such as ``pandas``, ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib``. I implemented a taxi price prediction with regression manually.
1. The assignment 1 was about searching for solution for 8 Queen problem. Implementing uninformed search such as ``BFS`` and ``IDS``, and ``A*`` as informed search.
2. The assignment 2 was Breakthrough Game. I implemented ``minmax`` and ``alpha-beta pruning`` algorithms in it.
3. The assignment 3 was predicting spam/ham in email using ``naive base``.
4. The assignment 4 was introductoin with ml using ``sklearn`` library for image recognization and classification. We had to use follwoing algorithms for ``CIFAR_10`` and ``MNIST`` dataset: <br/>
	* KNN
	* Decision Tree
	* Random Forest
	* Logistic Regression
	* K-Means
5. The assignment 5 was using CNN for ``CIFAR_10`` dataset with ``pytorch`` library.
6. The optional assignment was [Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries/) contest on ``Kaggle``

**Note 1**: I used ``Google Colab`` for last 3 assignments.<br/>
**Note 2**: My reports in jupyter files are written in persian language because it was a rule of our course.
