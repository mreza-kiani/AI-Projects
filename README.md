# AI Projects
These are my projects for Artificial Intelligence Course in Spring of 2019 semester. <br/>
We had seven mandatory projects and one optional project. <br/>

0. Assignment 0 mostly practiced with ``jupyter``, ``python`` & its essential libraries such as ``pandas``, ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib``. I implemented a taxi price prediction with regression manually.
1. Assignment 1 was about searching for a solution for 8 Queen problem. Implementing uninformed search such as ``BFS`` and ``IDS``, and ``A*`` as informed search.
2. Assignment 2 was Breakthrough Game. I implemented ``minmax`` and ``alpha-beta pruning`` algorithms in it.
3. Assignment 3 was predicting spam/ham emails using ``naive bayes``.
4. Assignment 4 was an introduction with ml using ``sklearn`` library for image recognization and classification. We had to use the following algorithms for ``CIFAR_10`` and ``MNIST`` dataset: <br/>
	* KNN
	* Decision Tree
	* Random Forest
	* Logistic Regression
	* K-Means
5. Assignment 5 was using CNN for ``CIFAR_10`` dataset with ``pytorch`` library.
6. Optional assignment was [Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries/) contest on ``Kaggle``

**Note 1**: I used ``Google Colab`` for last three assignments.<br/>
**Note 2**: My reports in jupyter files are written in Persian because it was a rule of our course.
